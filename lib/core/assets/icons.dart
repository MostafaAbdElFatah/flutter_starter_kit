/// This class is used to store all the icon assets paths.
///
/// By using this class, we can avoid using hardcoded strings in the code.
/// This makes it easier to manage and update the icon assets paths.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// SvgPicture.asset(SvgIcons.logo);
/// ```
abstract class SvgIcons {
  // Private constructor to prevent instantiation.
  SvgIcons._();
